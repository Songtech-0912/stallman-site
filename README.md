# Stallman Website Design

Mr. Stallman is perhaps one of the most brilliant, influential people in the world. However, his website can use some improvements! Here's my design for it.

The entire source code of the site is licensed under the free-as-in-freedom GPL 3.0 license. View the live demo at [](). Enjoy!

## Development

* The site uses Jekyll with pure CSS, no Sass (to not drag in additional dependencies)
* Both HTML and CSS is linted and validated before being pushed to production
* Code style is not strict, as long as it is readable and fits in with the surrounding code, I can accept it

## Getting started from sources

### Step 1

Clone this repository and enter it:

```
git clone https://github.com/Songtech-0912/stallman-site.git && cd stallman-site
```

### Step 2

Assuming you have `npm` and `npx` installed, start the server and go!

```
npx serve
```

Your default web browser should open with the website served live.
